            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Will code for catnip. No really, at this point I would.  I'd also do other things I wouldn't normally do just for the opportunity to build websites, webapps, programs, and other things to do with software development and coding. What you may ask? Well...uhm...let's see. How about watch an entire game of golf and then an entire baseball game....on NETWORK TELEVISION?!?!</p>

            <p>Hi everyone, I'm Alex. An aspiring web developer and software developer who's been aspiring to be one since high school and college graduation. Life has a way of taking people through different pathways in life, but I've learned that because of those paths, the thought of "what if" is no longer something I have to think about. Why? Because I've already done them. I've worked retail, as a dental assistant, as an account executive and now an administrative assistant. After doing these things, I've no doubt in my mind that my younger self was absolutely right!</p>

            <p>Also if you can't tell I'm a fan of video games. Particularly video games from any of the following consoles: NES, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, PlayStation (original gray one), Dreamcast, Wii, and the PC. Still, I like video games enough to keep up with news on them. Also I'm a sports guy. Tennis as #1, but also a fan of the NFL, track and field, and other sports usually played at the Olympics. Also, I LOVE music. I can't play it, but I like all kinds of genres. A few of them being Smooth Jazz (I'm not kidding), R&B, a little bit of pop music, a lot from the 70s up to the early 2000s, K-Pop (I'm not kidding), Acid Jazz, Alternative, Indie, video game soundtracks and remixes...just about anything that sounds good.</p>
